 React Query- The "missing" data-fetching library for React🔆

React Query is a library for fetching and caching data in React applications.

It provides a declarative API for fetching, storing, and retrieving data. React Query is designed to be used with React Hooks.

⚙️ Why React Query?
👉 It can help make your application more responsive by caching data and automatically refetching it when necessary.

👉 React Query can improve the performance of your application by batching requests and avoiding unnecessary network traffic.

👉 Makes it easier to handle errors by providing a builtin error handling mechanism.
