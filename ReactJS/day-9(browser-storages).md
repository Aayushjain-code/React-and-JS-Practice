⚙️ We are offered various options by which we store the website’s data on the user’s browsers, also known as browser storage

⚙️ It consists of JavaScript APIs that allow us to store data on the client (i.e., on the user's machine), and then it could be retrieved when needed.

#### Why should we store data in the browser?


⚙️ Performance - data stored locally in the user's browser is instantaneously available.

⚙️ Persisting data from a previous browsing session like your username, storing the contents of a shopping cart from the previous session.

⚙️ Personalization of the site settings/preferences that affect how your page renders

⚙️ Settings like the user’s choice of color scheme, font size, whether some UI elements are visible or not.

⚙️ Saving data and assets you want to keep handy if the network connection goes offline or for the site to load quicker.
